                <p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, construction site falls account for one of every three construction related fatalities. Workers from every trade are injured when falls are caused by defective ladders, scaffolds, or construction debris. Falls occur in a wide variety of circumstances. The distance of the fall is not necessarily related to the amount of harm; injuries with catastrophic consequences often occur in falls of only a few feet.</p>

                <p>According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, around 400 fatalities occur every year from electrocutions at construction sites. Every year, nonfatal electrical accidents severely limit victims' ability to lead normal lives, necessitating extensive rehabilitation and medical treatment that creates extreme financial hardships for the victims' families.

                </header>
                <p>Trenching accidents can occur in tunnels, mines, sewers, stormwater drains, manholes, or any other enclosed spaces. Trenching accidents can lead to brain damage, spinal cord injuries, suffocation, and wrongful death. Oftentimes improper shoring or support leads to trench collapse. This is why it's important to hire construction accident attorneys who have the experience and highly trained experts needed to conduct a full investigation.</p>

                <p>Especially when it comes to construction projects that involve multiple levels or floors of a building or structure, falling debris and objects like tools, beams, or building materials are known for striking workers on the levels below. Employers and contractors are required to provide safe working environments, yet these sorts of construction accidents happen frequently. If you've suffered workplace injuries by falling debris or objects, contact an experienced construction accident attorney.</p>

                </header>
                <p>Construction equipment is often extremely heavy and very dangerous. Many construction equipment accidents are due to manufacturing defects, equipment malfunction, lack of instruction and warning, or inadequate supervision. When these machines or their operators fail, the results are often debilitating, life threatening, or fatal construction accidents. The attorneys at Steven C. Lee & Associates will find who's at fault.</p>

                <p>Construction workers frequently work with or in close proximity to substances that can pose a threat to their welfare, due to their toxicity. When working near toxic substances is unavoidable, construction companies, property managers, and contractors are required to supply construction workers with the appropriate safety equipment and follow strict safety regulations to prevent workers from harmful exposure of toxic substances. Unfortunately, this doesn't always happen.</p>

            <p>Getting you the compensation you deserve in a construction accident demands a full investigation of the accident site, interviewing witnesses and gathering the documentation needed to support liability and damages. For many construction accidents, your attorney needs to know the federal and state regulations that apply to the responsible parties. As your attorneys, we will hold the guilty parties responsible for your construction accident injuries or loss.</p>

                  <p>Work-related injuries are generally covered by workers’ compensation insurance, so long as they were sustained in the course and scope of your employment. However, workers’ compensation benefits do not always cover every expense a worker might face, nor do they always cover future expenses. Also, there is no benefit awarded for pain and suffering.</p>

For example, an equipment manufacturer may have defectively designed the product, or there was a defect in its assembly rendering it unreasonably dangerous for its intended use. As your attorneys, we will find all the parties responsible for your injury.</p>
