                  <p>The law allows for the parents, spouses, and children of the decedent to bring a suit in a Texas court for damages caused by the wrongful death. Siblings of the decedent may not bring a claim for the loss of a brother or sister. A partner in a same-sex relationship is not permitted under Texas law to bring a wrongful death action. A survival claim may be brought by the decedentâ€™s estate or heirs to recover for medical and funeral expenses and for any mental anguish the decedent experienced prior to the death. If the decedent died immediately, there is no claim for the decedentâ€™s mental anguish.</p>

                  <h5 class="ryl-bold-heading">FINANCIAL LOSS</h5>
                  <p>The court will look into certain factors in determining you and your family's financial loss. This includes the earning potential of the decedent, his or her health, life expectancy, and assets. If the decedent was a housekeeper and did not have an outside job, you are still entitled to financial loss based on the value of the decedentâ€™s role in childcare, housekeeping, and assistance with the familyâ€™s daily living needs. For your emotional loss, the jury or trier-of-fact will consider the strength of the relationship between you and the decedent. As your attorneys, we fight for you in court to make sure you are fully compensated.</p>

For emotional losses, we will review in depth with you the relationship you and other family members had with the decedent. We include family biographies, photographs, and testimonials. If exemplary damages are possible, such as in a drunk driving fatality or assault case, we will gather the evidence needed to support your exemplary damage claim.</p>

If your claim is against a corporation or large business entity, or involves medical malpractice, the defendants will often retain a large and experienced team of defense lawyers who will attempt to intimidate you and contest your claim every step of the way.
