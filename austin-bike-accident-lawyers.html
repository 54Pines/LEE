                </header>
                <p>While helmets and protective clothing certainly save lives and reduce injuries, bicycles offer their riders little protection. Especially not when it comes to the force of a 5,000 lb motor vehicle. Our highly trained experts know exactly how to pick apart the scene of an accident and establish driver negligence. However, it's crucial we get to the scene quickly, so that the evidence can be preserved, so don't delay. Always make sure to avoid giving any statements to the insurance adjusters without talking to a qualified attorney first.</p>

                <p>Commercial truck drivers are subject to both state and federal regulations. Because of this, and the fact that bicycle collisions with trucks can be exceptionally harmful to the rider, it is oftentimes easier to prove negligence and secure compensation in bike accidents that involve commercial trucks. If someone you know has been injured in a bicycle accident involving a truck, have them contact qualified bike accident lawyers right away. The faster you act, the more we can help.</p>

                <p>While the vast majority of bicycle accidents involve negligence on the part of motorists, bike-only accident cases do happen. Since these typically mean that we are fighting against a bicycle manufacturer for making a defective product, or against a government entity for failing to properly maintain a road, these cases can be extremely complex. Nevertheless, we are prepared & equipped to handle these types of cases, and have a proven track record of winning our clients compensation.</p>

            <p>The steps you take immediately after an accident happens play a big role in how successful your claim will be. Taking the right steps is half the battle.</p>

                  <h5 class="ryl-bold-heading">STAY CALM & WAIT FOR THE POLICE</h5>
                  <p>It's very important to wait for the police at the scene of the accident, even if you don't think you are injured. Adrenaline may cause you to not realize the extent of your injuries. Make sure the police file an accurate report that takes your side of the story into account.</p>

                  <h5 class="ryl-bold-heading">LIMIT WHAT YOU SAY TO THE DRIVER</h5>
                  <p>Try to get the driver's name, address, phone number, driver's license number, plate number, & insurance information without making statements about whose fault it is. Oftentimes the driver may be apologetic at the scene, but will later recant.</p>

                  <p>Taking notes at the scene is invaluable. Try to get contact info from any witnesses present. If at all possible, take photos of the damage to the car and your bike, of any injuries to your person, and of the physical location. Note the time, date, and weather.</p>

                  <p>Even if you think your bicycle accident injuries are minor, seeking medical attention is the right thing to do. This shows that you took your injuries seriously, and that the court should too. After that, the next step is hiring a qualified bicycle accident attorney.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 40px">"I was riding my bike at night when a drunk driver hit me with his car. Even though he was driving without his headlights on and was arrested for a DUI, he claimed that he wasn't drunk and tried to avoid having a breathalyzer. The injuries I suffered put me out of work, but I hired Steven C. Lee as my bike accident lawyer and he was able to not only get my medical bills paid for, but he also got me payment for lost wages and the stress of not being able to ride my bike. I was very pleased with his representation, and have recommended Steven C. Lee to my friends."</p>
